# Google-Data-Analytics-CaseStudy
Course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone

## Introduction
In this case study, I will be performing several real-world tasks of a junior data analyst at a fictional company called Cyclistic. I will be implementing steps of the data analysis processs:[Ask,Prepare,Process,Analyze,Share,Act] which I have learned throughout the course and applying it into this project

 ## Scenario
 Cyclistic, a bike-share program operating in Chicago, boasts a fleet of more than 5,800 bicycles stationed at 600 docking stations. Its unique feature lies in its commitment to inclusivity, offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes to cater to individuals with disabilities and those who cannot use conventional two-wheeled bikes. While the majority of riders prefer traditional bicycles, approximately 8% opt for assistive options. Cyclistic serves both recreational riders and a significant 30% who use it for daily commuting.

Cyclistic's marketing strategy has traditionally revolved around creating general awareness and appealing to a wide consumer base. This was made possible through versatile pricing plans, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders are those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes, while Cyclistic members are annual membership holders.

A thorough financial analysis has revealed that annual members yield significantly higher profits compared to casual riders. In light of this, our marketing director, Moreno, is convinced that the future success of Cyclistic hinges on maximizing the annual membership base. Rather than targeting entirely new customers, Moreno envisions an opportunity to convert casual riders into members, given their existing familiarity with the Cyclistic program.

Moreno has outlined a clear objective: Formulate marketing strategies with the specific aim of transitioning casual riders into annual members. To achieve this, our marketing analyst team needs to gain a deeper understanding of the differences between annual members and casual riders, uncover the motivations behind casual riders opting for membership, and explore the role of digital media in influencing our marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are eager to dive into Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to uncover meaningful trends.

## Task
I have been tasked by Moreno to address the first question: "What are the distinctions in how annual members and casual riders utilize Cyclistic bikes?" Your objective is to generate this report and come up with a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
